\frametitle{How to use PyNE}

PyNE is a set of \emph{composable} tools
\begin{itemize}
\item Accomplish simple, general tasks, e.g.
\begin{itemize}
\item mix two materials
\item read MCNP output
\item collapse pointwise data into bins
\end{itemize}
\item PyNE code is meant to be used within larger applications
\end{itemize}
